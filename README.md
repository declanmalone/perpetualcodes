# An implementation of "Perpetual Codes", a type of Fountain Code

This is just a placeholder package at the moment. It is intended to
become a port/rework of my existing Perl/C implementations.

The existing Perl implementation is available as
[Net::PerpetualCodes](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::PerpetualCodes) on
CPAN. The source is available [on
github](https://github.com/declanmalone/gnetraid) under the
`Net-PerpetualCodes` directory.

Implementation based on a paper by Petar Maymounkov. The paper is
available from the author's website via [this
link](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-perpetual.ps)
(PostScript file).
